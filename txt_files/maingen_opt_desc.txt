General listing of options in Maingen. Options are ordered under subject.
Associated with each option are requested inputs. Some inputs are not
prompted for, and can only be changed from their default values by specifying
them in the call. eg.

		       CJBB(JONS=T)

Such input are placed in [ ]. If you see a hidden option which is not
described, check maingen.f. The option use may be obvious.

Many options, eg DC (departure coefficients) operate on many species.
The species is specified by direct attachment to the option call. For
example to plot departure coefficient for C2, issue command

			DC_C2

Options require species addenda are specified by a * --- eg DC_*.
All logs are base 10, unless specifically noted otherwise.

                         opacity and emissivity of a single species as a function
                         of depth and wavelength.
                    2. When no species is specified, the maximum fractional
