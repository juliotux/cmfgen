General listing of options in PLT_JH. Warning: Code originally developed
to plot J but later extended to plot H, Eta, and Chi. Be carefull with
labeling and units. Another possible trap is that EDDFACTOR is ouput
on the FINE grid, where as H, Eta and Chi are ouput on the regular grid. 
If comparing J, H etc, it may be better to us ethe EDDFACTOR file from the
CMFGEN computation, or alternatively, do not add extra points in the CMF_FLUX
computation.

Options are ordered under subject. Associated with each option are requested 
inputs. Some inputs are not prompted for, and can only be changed from their 
default values by specifying them in the call. eg.

		       RD_MOD(OVER=T)

Such inputs are placed in [ ].

SVE and BOX file:
	Default is to write file MAIN_OPT_STR.sve
	Append sve=filename to write a new .sve file (no brackets)
	Type box=filename to write a .box file containing several .sve files
	Type .filename to read .sve file
	Type #filename to read .box file

Input/output:

    RD_MOD  	Read in new data into MODEL B. Any previous model B data is lost.
                Data may be J, H, Eta, or CHI.

    MOD_A	Switch to model A as the default. B data is not destroyed.

    MOD_B	Switch to model B as the default. A data is not destroyed.
                     
X Axis Options
    LX		Switch between logarithmic and linear X-AXIS
    LOGX        (i.e. do opposite to current setting)
    LINX

    XU		Change units for X-axis. Options are:
    XUNITS	   Hz
		   um
		   Ang
		   keV
	           eV
		   km/s

Y Axis Options
    LY		Switch between logarithmic and linear Y-AXIS
    LOGY        (i.e. do opposite to current setting)
    LINY

    YU		   Change Y plot parameter. Options are:
    Y_UNITS 	      NAT     Default - avoids stuffing up ETA etc.
	              Flam    ergs/cm^2/s/Ang)
		      FNU     Jy
		      NU_FNU  ergs/cm^2/s

Main options.
    JD		Plot variable at a given depth as a function of Lambda
	          DEPTH   -- Depth index
    RSQJD       Plots RSQJ as a function of Lambda.
	          DEPTH   -- Depth index
	          [SCALE] -- Scaling factor for plot.
	          [ZEROV] -- Shifts plot to observers frame (velocity shift only)
    R3J         Plots Int r^3.J dv as a function of depth.
    JNU         Plots J at a given wavelength
                  LAMBDA  -- Wavelength in Angstroms (-ve assumed to be Hz).
	          [SCALE] -- Scaling factor for plot.
	          [RSQJ]  -- Plot r^2.J?
    SPHJ        Dirty option to modify J for sphericity effects.
    ES          Convloves (J) with electron scattering redistribution function.
    EJ          Plots energy density
    BB          Plots blackbody spectrum at a given temperature.
    CF		Plots the integrated flux (H) as a function of depth.
    CFD		Plots the integrated flux (H) as a function of frequencey at a given depth.  
    PHOT        Normalized plot showing source of ionizations for 1/v^3 cross-section,
    dBdR        Compute 1/3 dB/dR for comparision with CHI x FLUX (check on diffusion approximation)
    INT         Compute Int J dv & Int dJ/dlnv dv, and plot as a function of depth (diagnostic)
    DNU.        Plots c.dNU/NU as a function on NU (diagnostic) 

Output

   EXTJ         Extends J (from A model) in R, creating a new data file J_DATA
                and its corresponding file J_DATA_INFO. These can be used to
                help facilitate convergence when extending model to much
                larger radii.
   WR_ID        Writes out file names of files read.
