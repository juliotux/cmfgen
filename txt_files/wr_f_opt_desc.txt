22,16   		!Output formatting parameters.

General listing of options in WR_F_TO_S. Options are ordered under subject.
Associated with each option are requested inputs. Some inputs are not
prompted for, and can only be changed from their default values by specifying
them in the call. eg.

		       RD_MOD(OVER=T)

Such inputs are placed in [ ].

SVE and BOX file
	Default is to write file MAIN_OPT_STR.sve
	Append sve=filename to write a new .sve file (no brackets)
	Type box=filename to write a .box file containing several .sve files
	Type .filename to read .sve file
	Type #filename to read .box file

Input:

   RD_LNK
        Reads in an old link file. Any existing link information is 
           overwritten.

   RD_SM_LNK
        Reads in an old link file, but which has a smaller number of 
           levels than the present atomic model. Any existing link 
           information is overwritten. Generally used when moving from 
           an atom with no split terms to one with split terms. Each 
           level in a term is assigned to the same super level.

   RD_DC
        Reads in departure coefficients from a  model for the atom under
           consideration. These data can be then used in assisting the
           assignments of super levels.


Output:

   WR
        Outputs revised links to file, in a format suitable for CMFGEN.
      [WRITE_DC] : Outputs DC for each level if available
      [HEAD]     : Outputs a default header. In general this will 
                      need editing.

   TY
	Outputs revised links to the screen
      [WRITE_DC] : Outputs DC for each level if available
        
   SL_WR
      Output levels ordered according to their SUPER level. This allows
          an easy check of your SL assignments.
      [WRITE_DC] : Outputs DC for each level if available

    WR_DC
      The routine reads a file containing EXCTATION temperatures (created 
      using DISPGEN) for the next lowest ionization stage. The excitation
      temperature of the ground state is then used to comute the ION 
      population, and the departure coefficients for all other levels. 
      Routine is useful when including an additional ionization stage.  
      Outouts departure coefficent file for the curent species.  Reads 
      in the exciations temperature for the lower ionization stage.

Link options:

   CL
       Renumbers links so that they are consecutively numbered.
        This options assumes that all SUPER LEVEL ID's are positive,
          and UNIQUE.

       This option useful when you have changed existing super-level
         assignments in the F_TO_S link specification FILE.
       For example, to split an existing super-level in 2 super levels
         edit the old F_TO_S file, giving these 2 new super levels
         unique ID's. Then use RD option followed by CL.

   LS
       Links together levels that belong to the same term, independent
         of their energy separation.

   ELS
       Link levels together that belong to the same multiplet. If a
         Super-Levels last level is within DEL_E cm^-1 of the lowest
         energy of a previous super-level, the two super levels are 
         combined. The default is to combine only those super levels
         having the same SPIN and PARITY.
   E%LS
       Link levels together that belong to the same multiplet, and 
        to other levels if they are within a certain percentage of the
        excitation energy of the state. iAutomatically  fives coarser
        super-level assignments for levels close to the ionization limit.
        The default is to combine only those super levels having the same
        SPIN and PARITY.

       DEL_E: Maximum energy separation (in cm^{-1]) of levels within a
           super level.
       [CHK_P]: If set to false, no check on PARITY is done when merging
           super levels.
       [CHK_S]: If set to false, no check on SPIN is done when merging
           super levels.

   SP      
       Groups levels together that are within DEL_E cm^-1 of the energy
         of the lowest level in the SUPER-LEVEL. The default is to
         combine only those levels having the same SPIN and PARITY.

       NB: Not all members of a multiplet will necessarily belong to
         the same Super Level.

       DEL_E= Maximum energy separation (in cm^{-1]) of levels within a
           super level.
       [CHK_P]: If set to false, no check on PARITY is done when merging
           super levels.
       [CHK_S]: If set to false, no check on SPIN is done when merging
           super levels.
 
   SPLIT
         Allows a coarse SUPER level assignment to be refined according
           to the energy separation of levels, and the difference in
           departure levels (e.g., as computed using FULL LS coupling).

       ACC= If the departure coefficients differ by more than ACC %, they 
               will be gropoed into a new super level.
       DEL_E= If the energy separation is > DEL_E (cm^-1), a new super
               level is created.
               
   SEP
         Ouputs the maximum energy separation between levels in EACH
            super level.
